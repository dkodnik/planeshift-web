WC - Added back resource, waypoint and locations map from the old wc patch by ravna
*** 2009-05-02 by Stefano Angeleri
WC -validatequest:
    added more explicit warnings for missing : after menu or P, (before it said "Unknown command").
    Also added a check to warn for missing ':' after any trigger that is more than 3 characters 
    long. (basically "Menu:" and "Full NPC Name:") shortened npc names are too short and can match anything.

    -process:
     added a list of all tranforms using a process in each "process details" section.
     Changed "item used" to "Work Item".
     Items now link to item details.

    -listprocess:
     Changed "item used" to "Work Item" on process listing in "checkusage".

    -Combines:
     added a dropdown for "result item" in edit combine.

WC -Combinations:
    Minor bugfix, sql query now also uses pattern_id in the query.
    in edit combination, added a dropdown with the pattern_name, 
    if it's changed, move it to another pattern.

   -pattern:
    transform list changed sorting to process name, source name, result name

   -npc_details: 
    fixed an html bug where the npc_master_id input box was 
    not properly named due to a missing " in the type field before it.
    Changed the source of the dropdown menu for loc_sector_id 
    from 1 that has "name, name" to one that has "id, name" so it can 
    properly update the ID (which is used in the npc details rather than the name.)

   -quest_parser: 
    fixed a bug where "give 1 Expert hammer" would be 
    misinterpreted as "give 1 exp" Changed it by checking for " exp" at the end 
    of the command instead of just " exp" anywhere in the command.
    added a link to "edit this script" after a script has been validated.

   -item_usage:
    method in listitem, lists all places where the selected item is used. 
    This method is also used to block deletion of items that 
    are still in use. For deletion, any references found in quest scripts do no 
    block because detection is only 98% accurate, so 
    there can be a random false positive in certain scripts (when a certain 
    line contains both the word "give" or "player gives" and the item name).

   -edit transform:
    added a dropdown with the pattern_name, if it's changed, move it to another pattern.

   -Process:
    changed sorting to include id and subprocess_number after name.

   -commonfunctions:
    prepselect('processes') to show only distinct results. (results that have both the same 
    id and name are subprocesses of each other, and ignored by the "id" anyway.
    Additionally, it now shows "id" in front of the name in the drop down, 
    so values with the same name can be distinguished.

WC - pattern listing:
     *changed transform/combine in edit pattern, 
     *all items now show their category
     *item ID's that have no corresponding ID in the item_stats table get labled as "BROKEN"
     *transforms get sorted by process name, result item
     *combinations get sorted by result item
     *resultant Quality got renamed to Result Q (only a cosmetic change, the underlying data is the same).
     *re-wrote the SQL queries with some fancy joins to collect all this data.
     *added direct links to "edit item" for all items.
     *items now have a seperate column for their quantity and their name. 
      (so they can be easily copied to excell/etc)

   - process:
     *garbage items get seperate column for name and count
     *processes sorted by: pri skill name, level, sec skill name, level, process_name

   - itemlist/edit: Changed it so after you are done editing, it will show a suppressed 
                    list again with the right category instead of not showing a category.

   - Spells: removed TARGET_GM, TARGET_NPC and TARGET_PVP. Also fixed a bug where "create spell" 
             tried to use database results (probably a leftover from a copy/paste action).

   - questparser: added a check for Menu: tags, a warning is added if they are longer than 80 chars. 
                  Also changed the item checker to only consider items of stat_type 'B' as valid. 
   -patterns: 
    Added a link to ID 0 in the pattern listing. 
    This shows all tranforms/combines with pattern ID 0 (no pattern). 
    These are the transforms/combines that are considered 
    "general knowledge" and are not associated with any pattern.
    
    -trasformations:
     You can now chose to leave either result_item or source_item empty, 
     if both are empty, an error is produced.
    
    -combinations:
     Now checks for at least 1 source item. 
     (This must be the top most source item in the list.)

   - fixed a wrong call in mscripts.php

*** 2009-04-22 by Stefano Angeleri
WC - Changed "list trainer" to only show table headers once. Re-wrote
     the code while doing so.
     Changed "list items" and all dropdown menu's with item to be sorted by
     name as well as by category instead of only category.
     Changed "list rule" and changed/added edit details, delete details, add
     details, delete rules, create rules.
     Changed process.php to accept "None" for garbadge items and primary
     skill ID and fixed a but in the "editsubprocess where a boolean was
     writen as 'true' instead of true. (Will evaluate to the same, but isn't
     right.)

     Added create/edit/delete combination.
     Added Delete pattern.

     existed when you click on a process name.
     added the quest validator (linked in "list quests")

*** 2009-04-10 by Stefano Angeleri
WC - commonfunctions::mysql_query2 changed timezone to UTC rather that using system 
     default (which varies between hosts, and generates warnings in PHP
     change all <? into <?php  (some servers may confuse <? with <?ASP or 
     just not recognise it at all. Added  a check to see if the host is running windows, 
     if it is, no server status will be printed. (since ps is not a valid windows command)
     create item: added checks to see if some of the fields that are of the "real" type 
     in the database are not filled in. If they are not filled in, we don't want 
     to sent them to the database either, since the default value of '0.0' works fine, 
     but sending an empty string returns an error.

     updated all queries (where needed) to work on the HEAD database. (see for more details below)

     NPC: list_spawn_rules       cstr_id_spawn_sector   changed to   sector_id
     item: locate items  -- put $iid in '' quotes, without this you can get an "unknown column" 
     error from mysql if the input isn't numeric rather than just returning "0 matches"
     rules: list spells & glyphs used, SQL: removed saved_progression_event, 
     saving_throw, saving_throw_value, target_effect. Changed caster_effect 
     to casting_effect, changed progression_event to outcome.

     spells: added exclude_target, cast_duration, range, aoe_radius, aoe_angle sql fields in all forms
     edit_item.php, create_item.php  deleted prg_evt_unequip and changed prg_evt_equip
     to equip_script and prg_evt_consume to consume_script SQL fields in all forms
     locate_item.php  added fields in the forms for the loc_xrot and loc_zrot sql fields.
     rules/factions.php, added the "faction_character" field

     Added a "create new transformation" link in "edit pattern" and and 
     in the main menu. Added the new transformation form.
     Added a "delete transformation" link in the "edit transformation" menu.

WC - Removed LIKE wildcard matches from the accounts table as this was causing
     live server delays of at least 15 minutes.

WC  - Added a new WC developed by Eriroley

      bandwidth usage and it's more updated
      (no broken queries all around). It's even more clean in it's implementation. The controls are also
      positioned in order to be easier and faster to use.
