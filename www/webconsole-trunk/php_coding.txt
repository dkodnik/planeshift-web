Try to avoid the use of double-quotes ("") for displaying strings, as PHP will parse the string to find a variable.  If you use single quoted strings ('') it will not try and the code will take less time to process.

This can cause problems when using things like $_POST['question'].  For a solution, use the concatenation operator (.) to glue strings together. (Ex: $text = 'Hi.  My name is Orogor.  May I ask you if ' . $_POST['question'] . '?';)

Echo should be used wherever text must be output.  It is marginally faster than printf.

Same for mysql_fetch_array:
Always provide a result_type of MYSQL_ASSOC or MYSQL_NUM for mysql_fetch_array.  The definition is:
array mysql_fetch_array ( resource result [, int result_type])

Technically, the result_type is not required and defaults to MYSQL_BOTH, but it can be MYSQL_ASSOC or MYSQL_NUM.  MYSQL_NUM provides a numerically keyed array, where MYSQL_ASSOC provides an array keyed by field name.  If you don't provide this argument or provide MYSQL_BOTH, result is only half as fast as if you use one of them.  MYSQL_ASSOC is only 1% slower than  MYSQL_NUM but far more easy to read.

When testing code, use mysql_query2() rather than mysql_query() because it will stop the script and display the mysql error if the query fails for some reason.  mysql_query2() is part of commonfunctions.php

WC is written using the guidelines provided in the HTML 4.01 Specification, and headers will reflect such in the near future.  Tags do not need to be written in uppercase, but it is requested that you do so to improve readability.  Much of the code is currently written using lowercase tags.  This will be corrected.  If you modify any of the code, please update the tags yourself where necessary. :)

PHP query keywords should also be written in uppercase, but table and field names should be written in the case they have been written in within the database.  For example, a query:  "SELECT * IN item_stats WHERE id=263"

Always put quotes around text keys in arrays.  'Nuff said.

Having all pages called from index.php allows us to check that the user is logged for viewing the pages.  It allows us to create a more extensible coding interface and helps keep things modular.
