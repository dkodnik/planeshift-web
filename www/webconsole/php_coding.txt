try to avoid the use of "..... " for displaing string , as php will parse the string to find a variable
if you use '.....' it will not try , you ll gain some speed
this cause problems when using things like $_POST['question']  for solving it glue strings toghether using a dot
$text = 'hi my name is orogor can i ask you if'.$_POST['question'].'?';

i dont know is echo is as fast as printf , but echo is surely more easy to read.

same for mysql_fetch_array:
array mysql_fetch_array ( resource result [, int result_type])
result_type can be MYSQL_ASSOC or MYSQL_NUM if you do not use this parameter the result is 2 time slower than if you use one
but  MYSQL_ASSOC is only 1% slower than  MYSQL_NUM but far more easy to read.

when using mysql_query()   always add a "or die(mysql_error())" a the end , it make the script stop and display the errorif there is one
$result = mysql_query( $a) or die(mysql_error());
that s the reason why i use mysql_query2() instead of mysql_query();

using some recent html normes you should write the tag into lowercase 
and the values of the parameters between simple or doubles quotes, i think 
than highercase wasn t mandatory before but it was more easy to read.

also , php is nice it support errors but it s better to not make ones like 
$_POST[question] is bad but it can works , if you  don t have a static who already have this name ,
 well in fact i think it doesn t work for $_POST vars but it works for normal arrays.
so use $_POST['question']

having all pages called from index.php allow to check than the user is at less logged for viewing the pages ,(you can t type an url and do something )
it also prevent to make massive includes while coding , this help to make more modular code.
